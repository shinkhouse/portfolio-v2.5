					I am currently a junior at Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa. I am expected to graduate in May of 2018. I have a GPA of 3.82. I have been on the Honor Roll three times (Fall 2014, Spring 2015, and Spring 2016) and the President's list once (Fall 2015). I am pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology with a minor in Web Design. During my time at Graceland University, I have been in both concert choir and chamber choir. During my second year of college, I was on the Academic Student Council. I was voted in as a member of the Advisory Council for the Academic Student Council. I assist a small group of house representative with coordinating and planning activities for students during the school year. I am a member of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Chapter on campus. We go to computing contests and compete in programming and robotics contests each year. This past year I was named an Ackerley Scholar. The Ackerley Scholar's attend weekly ACM meetings, go to programming contests, participate in service projects, and present scholarly work at Graceland's annual Scholar's Showcase Day each Spring.

					<h3>MUSCO LIGHTING</h3>

					<h4>May 2015 to August 2015, May 2016 to Current</h4>
					<p>During my time at Musco Lighting, I worked in the factory putting together brackets and plates for power devices. I assembled surge protection devices and built yokes and cones. I made and tested wire harnesses as well.</p>

					<h3>INFOCENTRAL STUDENT TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANT</h3>

					<h4>August 2014 to May 2016</h4>
					<p>During my time at Graceland University, I worked for InfoCentral at Graceland University. I assist student and faculty by fixing faulty cabling in projector carts, repairing student computers, setting up projectors, televisions, digital signage devices, and conference phones. I also deliver paper to various departments on campus and change out ink in the printers located on campus.</p>

					<h3>LOUISA MUSCATINE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT TECHNOLOGY INTERNSHIP</h3>

					<h4>August 2012 to July 2014</h4>
					<p>During my time as a high school student, I took part in an internship program in the technology department in my school district. I reported directly to the technology director each day to find out what my assignment would be. I would go around to both school buildings and service computers. I often took control in reimaging Mac desktop labs, Windows desktop labs, and Mac and Windows mobile labs. In addition, I would diagnose student and teacher's issues with technology on campus and provide them with solutions to problems they were facing. I constructed PDF documents that would provide a step-by-step instruction manual on how to perform certain intermediate tasks on the computer and provided various creative methods that could be used with technology in the classroom. If the technology director was busy working on another issue, it was my job to step up and offer my assistance. I was also the student representative to the District and High School Technology Committee's. I advised the committees on what direction I thought the school's should go in with their available funding.</p>
